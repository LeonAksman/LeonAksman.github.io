## Research

In general I'm interested in modelling the course of early neurodegeneration, particularly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, using a variety of multi-modal measures from neuroimaging, biofluids and cognitive testing. Starting from my PhD and continuing into my postdoctoral work, I have focussed on developing better methods for using the small amounts of longitudinal neuroimaging and other multi-modal measures to better discriminate early diseases and better model brain structural trajectories. 

My research approach involves adapting widely known, well validated and easy to interpret methods (e.g. Bayesian linear regressions, support vector machines and principal component analysis) to exploit the specific spatial or temporal structure of the problem I'm trying to solve.
