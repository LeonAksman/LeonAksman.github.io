## Research

I'm interesting in understanding how neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's progress over time. 

My research involves modelling the state and evolution of such diseases by combining computational modelling, statistics and machine learning with a variety of multi-modal measures from neuroimaging, biofluids and cognitive testing. 


I have worked on:

* Developing longitudinal pattern recognition and machine learning based models to discriminate early Alzheimer's ([paper]( https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23317)) and Parkinson's disease ([thesis](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/longitudinal-neuroimaging-features-for-discriminating-early-neurodegeneration(ac3aefdc-0cf2-4405-9edd-69e263129bdf).html)). You can find the toolbox [here](https://github.com/LeonAksman/lpr).

* Developing probabilistic biomarker trajectory models to characterize the course of neurodegeneration ([paper]( https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24682))([abstract](https://files.aievolution.com/hbm1801/abstracts/32082/2254_Aksman.pdf)). The toolbox is [here](https://github.com/LeonAksman/bayes-mtl-traj). 

* Applying event based models to stage the spread of Alzheimer's pathology within the brain. (<a href="Aksman_OHBM_2019.pdf">abstract</a>).

I'm also interested in making easy-to-use [tools](https://github.com/LeonAksman/vtkSnap) for visualizing results in neuroimaging.
