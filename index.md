## Research

I'm interesting in understanding how neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's progress over time. 

My research involves modelling the state and evolution of such diseases by combining computational modelling, statistics and machine learning with a variety of multi-modal measures from neuroimaging, biofluids and cognitive testing. 

I have worked on:

* Developing longitudinal pattern recognition and machine learning based models to discriminate early Alzheimer's ([paper]( https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23317)) and Parkinson's disease ([thesis](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/longitudinal-neuroimaging-features-for-discriminating-early-neurodegeneration(ac3aefdc-0cf2-4405-9edd-69e263129bdf).html)). You can find the toolbox [here](https://github.com/LeonAksman/lpr).

* Developing probabilistic biomarker trajectory models to characterize the course of neurodegeneration ([paper]( https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24682))([abstract](https://files.aievolution.com/hbm1801/abstracts/32082/2254_Aksman.pdf)). The toolbox is [here](https://github.com/LeonAksman/bayes-mtl-traj). 

* Applying event based models to stage the spread of Alzheimer's pathology within the brain. (<a href="Aksman_OHBM_2019.pdf">abstract</a>).

I'm also interested in making easy-to-use [tools](https://github.com/LeonAksman/vtkSnap) for visualizing results in neuroimaging.

## Academic Bio

Since 2017 I've been a a research associate at UCL. I'm a member of the Progression of Neurodegenerative Disease (POND) group run by Danny Alexander and Neil Oxtoby. I'm also a member of Andre Altmann's COMBINE lab. I completed my PhD at King's College London in 2017, working with Andre Marquand and Dave Lithgoe on developing machine learning based methods to discriminatie early neurodegeneration. 

## Previous lives

I spent six years in quantitative finance as a programmer/analyst/trader. Prior to that I did my Master's in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland, where I developed robotic manipulator control algorithms and some motor control electronics. Prior to *that* I did my undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University, majoring in electrical engineering.
