## Research

I'm interested in modelling the state and evolution of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's using a variety of multi-modal measures from neuroimaging, biofluids and cognitive testing. 

I work on methods that combine computational modelling, statistics and machine learning (i.e. pattern recognition) to tackle these problems. 

I have worked on:

* Longitudinal pattern recognition and machine learning based models for disease discrimination in Alzheimer's disease ([paper]()) and Parkinson's disease ([thesis](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/longitudinal-neuroimaging-features-for-discriminating-early-neurodegeneration(ac3aefdc-0cf2-4405-9edd-69e263129bdf).html)). You can find the toolbox [here](https://github.com/LeonAksman/lpr).

* Bayesian multi-task learning based trajectory models to characterize the course of neurodegeneration ([paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/593459v1))([abstract](https://files.aievolution.com/hbm1801/abstracts/32082/2254_Aksman.pdf)). 

* Event based models of the spread of amyloid and tau throughout the brain (upcoming). 

I'm also interested in making easy-to-use [tools](https://github.com/LeonAksman/vtkSnap) for visualizing results in neuroimaging. I wish I had more time for this work; I'm happy to collaborate if anyone wants to build on this project.
