## Research

I'm interested in understanding how neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's progress over time. 

My research involves modelling the evolution of these diseases by combining computational modelling, statistics and machine learning with data from neuroimaging, cognitive testing, biofluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other complementary data. 

I have worked on:

* Applying disease progression models, such as Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn; see Alex Young's [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05892-0)) to model the spread of Alzheimer's pathologies within the brain. Our most recent [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.418004v1) applies SuStaIn to (in vivo) amyloid PET, tau PET, CSF and (post mortem) neuropathology based measures to show that the progression of amyloid protein and tau protein based pathologies is best described by two subtypes: an 'amyloid-first' subtype in which amyloid pathology spread throughout the brain prior to the spread of tau and a 'tau-first' subtype in which tau precedes amyloid. 

* Co-developing (along with Peter Wijeratne) the [pySuStaIn](https://github.com/ucl-pond/pySuStaIn) package, a Python implementation of SuStaIn.

* Developing probabilistic biomarker trajectory models to characterize the course of neurodegeneration ([paper]( https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24682))([abstract](https://files.aievolution.com/hbm1801/abstracts/32082/2254_Aksman.pdf)). The toolbox is [here](https://github.com/LeonAksman/bayes-mtl-traj). 

* Developing longitudinal pattern recognition and machine learning based models to discriminate early Alzheimer's ([paper]( https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.23317)) and Parkinson's disease ([thesis](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/longitudinal-neuroimaging-features-for-discriminating-early-neurodegeneration(ac3aefdc-0cf2-4405-9edd-69e263129bdf).html)). You can find the toolbox [here](https://github.com/LeonAksman/lpr).

I'm also interested in making easy-to-use [tools](https://github.com/LeonAksman/vtkSnap) for visualizing results in neuroimaging.

## Academic bio

I've recently joined the [INI](https://www.ini.usc.edu/) at USC, where I will be continuing research in disease progression modeling of neurodegenerative diseases. Previously I was a postdoctoral research associate at UCL from 2017 to 2020. I was a proud member of both the [POND](https://ucl-pond.github.io/) group run by Danny Alexander and Neil Oxtoby and the [COMBINE](http://combine-lab.science/) lab run by Andre Altmann. Prior to UCL I completed my PhD in neuroimaging at King's College London in early 2017, working with Andre Marquand and David Lythgoe on machine learning based methods that discriminate early neurodegeneration. 

## Previous lives

I spent six years in quantitative finance as a programmer/analyst/trader. Prior to that I completed a Master's in aerospace engineering at the University of Maryland, working on robotic manipulator control algorithms and some motor control electronics. Prior to *that* I studied at Johns Hopkins University, majoring in electrical engineering.
