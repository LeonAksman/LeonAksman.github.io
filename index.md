## Research

I'm interested in modelling the state and evolution of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's using a variety of multi-modal measures from neuroimaging, biofluids and cognitive testing. During my PhD and in my postdoc work, I have focussed on developing ways of using scarse longitudinal information to better discriminate early disease states and understand how healthy and diseased individuals' brains change over time. 

In my PhD work, summarized in my [thesis](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/longitudinal-neuroimaging-features-for-discriminating-early-neurodegeneration(ac3aefdc-0cf2-4405-9edd-69e263129bdf).html), I developed a longitudinal pattern recognition based method to better discriminate between subjecs with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal subjects using high-dimensional structural MRI. I also showed that the same method could be applied to better discriminate Parkinson's disease using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). I developed a freely available MATLAB [toolbox](https://github.com/LeonAksman/lpr) for performing both (standard) cross-sectional and longitudinal classification based on my method.
