## Research

I'm interested in modelling the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's using a variety of multi-modal measures from neuroimaging, biofluids and cognitive testing. During my PhD and in my postdoc work, I have focussed on developing better ways of using small amounts of longitudinal information to discriminate early diseases states and model individuals' brain structural trajectories. 

My research has adapted widely known, well validated and (relatively) easy to interpret methods (e.g. Bayesian linear regressions, support vector machines and principal component analysis) to the specific spatial or temporal structure of the problem I'm trying to solve.

 In my PhD work, summarized in my thesis (https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/longitudinal-neuroimaging-features-for-discriminating-early-neurodegeneration(ac3aefdc-0cf2-4405-9edd-69e263129bdf).html), I developed a longitudinal pattern recognition based method to better discriminate between subjecs with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal subjects using high-dimensional structural MRI. I also showed that the same method could be applied to discriminate Parkinson's disease using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).
