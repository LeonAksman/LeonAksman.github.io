## Research

I'm interested in modelling the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's using a variety of multi-modal measures from neuroimaging, biofluids and cognitive testing. During my PhD and in my postdoc work, I have focussed on developing better methods for using the small amounts of longitudinal neuroimaging and other multi-modal information to better discriminate early diseases states and better model individuals' brain structural trajectories. 

My research has adapted widely known, well validated and easy to interpret methods (e.g. Bayesian linear regressions, support vector machines and principal component analysis) to exploit the specific spatial or temporal structure of the problem I'm trying to solve.
